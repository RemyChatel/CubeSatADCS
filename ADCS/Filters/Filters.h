 * @brief
 * A library for filtering attitude quaternion and other signals
 * 
 * @details
 * # Description
 * A set of algorithm to filter the attitude quaternion of a spacecraft. It implements
 * a 7 state (quaternion and angular rates) Extended Kalman Filter.
 * 
 * It can be use to filter out noise in space applications for instance in Atitude
 * Determination and Control Systems. 
 * 
 * @see Filters::KalmanFilter
 * 
 * ## Working principle of the filter
 * Now that the attitude quaternion has been estimated with QuEst, it is very likely
 * that the result will have some noise and further filtering is required.
 * 
 * The Kalman filter is an algorithm that computes the best estimate of the state for
 * a time-varying process. Its predictor-corrector structure computes what the new state
 * should be according to the model and the elapsed time since the last update (prediction).
 * Then, it compares the prediction to the measured state in order to update the prediction
 * (correction) as shown in the figure below. The strength of the correction is
 * determined by the Kalman gain, which is computed using the different noise's covariances
 * 
 * This method avoids integrating since the fixed epoch, as the integration is done only
 * between two iterations of the filter while carrying the information of past measurements
 * to the next step to provide a better prediction.

 * 
 * ## Initialisation
 * The Kalman filter is initialized with knowledge of the spacecraft dynamic model and
 * statistical information about the process and the sensors (the covariance).
 * 
 * In the context of this project, the system state will be the combination of the
 * attitude quaternion and the angular rates. The resulting 7-state allows to propagate
 * the rotation of the spacecraft according to its dynamic model:
 * 
 * @f{align}{ 
 *     \dot{\mathbf{\omega}}   & = I^{-1} \left( -\mathbf{\omega}^\times I \mathbf{\omega} + \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \right)\\
 *     \dot{\mathbf{\epsilon}} & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \eta \mathbf{1} + \mathbf{\epsilon}^\times \right) \mathbf{\omega}\\
 *     \dot{\eta}     & = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{\epsilon}^T \mathbf{\omega}
 * @f}
 * 
 * Where @f$I@f$ is the inertia matrix of the satellite, @f$\eta@f$ the scalar part of
 * the attitude quaternion, @f$\epsilon@f$ the vector part of the quaternion, @f$\omega@f$
 * the angular rates, @f$u@f$ the control torque and @f$w@f$ the disturbance torque.
 * 
 * # Example code
 * 
 * @see Filters.test.cpp
 *
 * # Dependencies
 * This library depends on the "Matrix" library that can be found
 * here: https://github.com/RemyChatel/
 * 
 * In turn this library relies on <std::cmath> and <std::vector>
 * 
 * @attention This library uses float only (NOT double) and therefore
 * expect 6 to 7 significant figures

 * # Description
 * This class implements a 7-state (quaternion and angular rates)
 * Extended Kalman Filter for spacecraft atitude filtering.
 *
 * The initial inputs are the following:
 * - The inertia matrix of the satellite (3x3)
 * - The initial covariance matrix P (7x7)
 * - The process noise covariance matrix Q (7x7)
 * - The measurement noise covariance matrix R (7x7)
 * - The initial quaternion and angular rates
 * - The inertia matrix of the reaction wheels
 *
 * Once set up, the Kalman filter will predict the next quaternion using
 * an integration of how the system should evolve and the following inputs:
 * - The new measured quaternion
 * - The new measured angular rates
 * - The time ellapsed since last filter update
 * - The torques and angular rates of the control system of the spacecraft
