 * @brief
 * Test framework library for the Matrix module
 * 
 * @details
 * # Description
 * This library provides a test function for the Matrix module and also
 * serves as an example program for the module.
 * 
 * 
 * @see Matrix.h
 * 
 * # Dependencies and data type
 * This library depends on:
 * - the Mbed framework (https://www.mbed.com/en/)
 * - <std::cmath> in order to perform cos, sin and sqrt operations.
 * - <std::vector> for the matrix algebra
 * 
 * @attention This library uses float (32-bits) and not double (64-bits)
 * to make best use of the Floating Point Unit of 32-bits microcontrollers.
