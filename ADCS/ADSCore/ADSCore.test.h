 * @brief
 * Test framework library for the ADScore module
 * 
 * @details
 * # Description
 * This library provides a test function for the ADSCore module and also
 * serves as an example program for the module.
 * 
 * @see ADSCore.h
 * 
 * # Dependencies and data type
 * This library depends on:
 * - the Mbed framework (https://www.mbed.com/en/)
 * - <std::cmath> in order to perform cos, sin and sqrt operations.
 * - <std::vector> for the matrix algebra
 * - "Matrix.h" for matrices implementation
 * - "Estimators.h" for the QuEst algorithm
 * - "Filters.h" for the Kalman Filter
 * - "AstroLib.h" for the reference vector models
 * - "SunSensor.h" to access the Sun sensor
 * - "MPU9150.h" to access the IMU
 * 
 * @attention This library uses float (32-bits) and not double (64-bits)
 * to make best use of the Floating Point Unit of 32-bits microcontrollers.

/**
 * @brief
 * Testing function for the ADSCore module
 * 
 * This method test the ADSCore module by fetching data from an IMU
 * (through I2C) and a Sun sensor (3 analog channel), then it generates
 * reference vector from models and estimate the attitude using the
 * Quaternion Estimator algorithm. Finally, the output is filtered through
 * a Kalman Filter to improve accuracy.
 * 
 * Runs in an infinite loop an print the results on the Serial port.
 * 
 * @return 1 if successful, 0 otherwise
