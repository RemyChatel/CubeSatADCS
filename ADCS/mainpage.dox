/**

 *
 * @section Description
 * 
 * 
 * @section Dep Dependencies and Compatibility
 * This library needs <std::cmath>, <std::vector> and the ARM Mbed (https://www.mbed.com/en/) framework to work properly.
 * However, changing away from Mbed to make it work on other platforms should not be too difficult.
 * 
 * @section Comments
 * @attention This library uses float only (NOT double) and therefore
 * expect 6 to 7 significant figures
